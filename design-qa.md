# Style 1 Design QA

## Visual Target

- Source: /Users/tsunghan/.codex/generated_images/019f3c4c-12d8-7672-9075-76b286aa3261/exec-e77252b9-4d94-4f2f-b6ac-069dbc8c76a2.png
- Implementation: /private/tmp/invoice-style1-final.png
- Full page: /private/tmp/invoice-style1-final-full.png
- Mobile: /private/tmp/invoice-style1-mobile.png
- Full comparison: /private/tmp/invoice-style1-comparison.png
- Focused invoice comparison: /private/tmp/invoice-style1-preview-comparison.png
- Desktop CSS viewport: 1488 x 1056, device scale factor 1.
- Source raster normalized to 1488 x 1056 for comparison; implementation 1488 x 1056.
- State: fictional buyer, two teaching/material lines, subtotal 14000, tax 700, total 14700; three teaching allocation proposals; settings collapsed; scroll position zero.

## Comparison History

1. Initial render: P1 editor/preview structure corrected to the selected two-column design. P2 item table below the first viewport and oversized proposal cards remained.
2. Moved buyer information above invoice settings; moved memo and totals below the item table; collapsed draft files, source comparison, and advanced tax fields. Increased invoice text readability; replaced the blue stamp reminder with a small neutral stamp field.
3. Tightened invoice row height and proposal cards. All three proposal cards now fit in the reference desktop viewport (last card bottom about 1021px). Re-captured at scrollY 0 and compared full and focused regions.

## Fidelity Surfaces

- Typography: system Traditional Chinese sans-serif UI, modest serif invoice heading; no hero-sized headings. Small invoice type is intentionally denser than UI text.
- Spacing/layout: 42/58 editor/preview tracks, fine vertical divider, white unframed sections, compact proposal rows. Necessary invoice-number and review fields cause a modest extra left-column height compared with the concept.
- Colors: white ground, charcoal type, restrained teal actions, muted amber draft status. No gradient cards or blue stamp panel.
- Assets: actual Lucide download/printer/plus SVG assets with license; loaded successfully in browser. The invoice is editable HTML rather than a flattened mock image.
- Copy/content: omitted unimplemented history/customer/catalog tabs because database work is deferred. Available draft import/export uses a real menu. Source proposal wording is adapted to the existing calculation engine, not the mock's illustrative proposals. Reference sample address is not invented when absent from source text.

## Functional Checks

- Description parsing and 14700 total verified.
- Advanced price/tax controls reveal and hide verified.
- Proposal B apply, selected feedback, and undo verified.
- Proposal details expansion verified.
- PNG download verified.
- Mobile 390 x 844: no whole-page horizontal overflow, editor/preview switch and download control verified; invoice can scroll horizontally within its preview.
- Lucide assets nonblank and loaded.
- Browser console: zero errors and warnings on final validation page.
- JavaScript syntax checks and git diff whitespace check passed.

## Residual Differences / Follow-up Polish

- P3: printed invoice font and rule proportions are not pixel-identical to the generated reference; the editable paper supports five rows and longer notes.
- P3: optional future history/customer/catalog navigation remains deferred with database work.
- Safari-specific PNG behavior not tested in this run.

final result: passed

## Transaction Parsing and Interaction Correction

- Corrected labeled multiline item names and standalone unit-price equations; regression fixtures use fictional buyer data only.
- Price confirmation now parses unprocessed source text before applying the selected price type. Explicit source pricing wins on a fresh parse unless the user deliberately confirms an override.
- Source-based proposals preserve original line items, quantities, and transaction context. Applying and undoing a proposal restores its memo as well.
- Real proposal radios, invoice-kind controls, and invoice-period selection were exercised in the browser. Fixed the period input/change event race.
- Recalibrated the two-column layout, compact review controls, invoice header, and Chinese grand-total row against the supplied reference. Navigation targets existing sections; database features remain deferred.
- Verified: multiline source with unit price 1200 and quantity 4 produces net 4800, tax 240, gross 5040 when confirmed untaxed; two-line teaching/material example produces gross 14700.
- Parser regression checks, JavaScript syntax checks, whitespace checks, PNG download, proposal selection/undo, and 390px mobile overflow checks passed. Final browser console: zero errors or warnings.

- Remaining limits: parsing is local rule-based recognition, not unrestricted AI; print typography is not pixel-identical to the generated reference; Safari-specific export is untested.
